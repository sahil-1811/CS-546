          Life as a Trainer of Dragon
      </h1>
      <p>
          When I was 5 years old, while I was walking by the river, I found a large egg and brought the egg at my place.
          I was playing with that egg and tried to feed that egg. I also used to talk with that egg with random talks.
          Even after coming back from school, I used to play with that egg and sleep with that egg. So after 10-15 days,
          I remember like at 3 pm, I heard a cracking sound and saw that a baby dragon was coming from that egg.
          Firstly, I screamed and called my mom to watch this moment, even my mom was scared and told me that this baby dragon 
          will not stay in our house. I insisted mom and like after arguing with my mom for 3-4 hours, finally she told yes 
          to keep that dragon and I was very excited like I got a new brother.    
      </p>
      <p>
          From here, my new life started, Like I used to babysit that baby dragon with water, milk and food items. I used to play 
          with that dragon. He was like a brother to me and I was very happy spending time with him. I used to watch videos on 
          Youtube and also read lots of articles on "How to train a dragon?". As time passed, the baby dragon grew, and was growing 
          in size, so my parents told me to keep that dragon where I founded it. I again argued with them but it was of no use now.
          I was very disappointed and took the dragon with me and left it near the riverside.
      </p>
      <p>
        So after coming back home, I was very disappointed and didnt even ate my dinner that night and slept. The next day, after 
        my finishing my school and all the homework, I went to that riverside and spend time with that dragon secretly.
        One day, I saw a flame coming out from the mouth of dragon. I was very astonished as I had fantasy about dragons.
        I used to play with that dragon like I used to command that dragon to burn that stick or burn that leaf like a trainer.
        The dragon use to lick my face whenever it was time to go home. Also, he used to give me ride on his back and we use to ride
        entire village and it was like fun. It was like Game of Throne becoming true. The only thing missing was The Night King: Haha.
      </p>
      <p>
          One day, I went to that place and saw the dragon was missing and I was upset as I was not able to find him anywhere
          So, I was like finding that dragon for about 5 hours, and finally saw the dragon flying above the sky and throwing flames
          I was very happy seeing him back. When he landed, he came nearme and hugged me tightly. 
      </p>
      <p>
          After that time, I used to visit that dragon everyday and feed him and always take a ride from him.
          Once I took the dragon to my house and called my mom outside and told him I was sitting on dragon and laughing and
          then we flew away high up in the sky.
          This way, I used to spend my time with that dragon and trained him like a professional trainer.
